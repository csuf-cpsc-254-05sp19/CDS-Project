OVERVIEW: 
We will improve upon a game of Snake, adding in obstacles & multiple 
apples that will add different lengths to the snake. The obstalces 
will be there to make the game a little more difficult than normal. 
The apples can appear 2-3 times and when all are eaten, the next few 
will appear. Apples will have different colors. The different colors 
will add different lengths to the snake. All of this could be changed.

GOALS: 
To create a game that people can enjoy 

RESOURCES: 
TBD

New Features: 
Obstacles 
Apples adding various lengths
Maybe reverse it
