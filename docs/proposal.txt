OVERVIEW: 
We will improve upon a game of Snake, adding in multiple 
apples that will decrease the length of the snake. 
The apples can appear 2-3 times and when all are eaten, the next few 
will appear. Possibly change the speed of the snake to make the game more challenging. All of this could be changed.

GOALS: 
To create a game that people can enjoy
