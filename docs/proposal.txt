OVERVIEW: 
We will improve upon a game of Snake, adding in obstacles & multiple 
apples that will add or delete different lengths to the snake. The obstacles 
will be there to make the game a little more difficult than normal. 
The apples can appear 2-3 times and when all are eaten, the next few 
will appear. Apples may have different colors. The different colors will 
add or remove different lengths to the snake. All of this could be changed.

GOALS: 
To create a game that people can enjoy
